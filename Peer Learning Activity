ethernet

The basic Layer-2 frame/MAC world most networks use. VLANs and lots of other features sit on top of it.

ethtool

Kernel interface for NIC knobs. Check speed/duplex, offloads, queues, pause frames, and driver/firmware info.

handshake

Kernel helper for doing standard crypto/key-exchange handshakes, instead of every driver rolling its own.

hsr

"High-Avalibility Seamless Redundancy" 
Whenever a ethernet data frame is sent out from a hsr enabled device (a ring network of doubly attached nodes) it is duplicated and also sent the oposite direction. This allows for redundancy with no down time if the frame fails. 

ieee802154

Outlines a standard protocool for small wireless personal area networks. Maximum data rate allowed 250 kb/s.

ife

In charge of routing network packets as well as handling IP assignment and configuration on a network. Allows IP forwarding and tunneling.

ipv6/ila
"Identifier Locator Adressing"
Splits a network objects network identifier from its specified location. The location is then adressed.

mpls

Legacy method for packet routing and tunneling through the use of lables to identify a packet. 

mptcp
