# DNS RESOLVER PRESENTATION

6lowpan

6lowpan provides support and IPv6 compression IEEE.

802

Security at the switch/Wi-Fi port. When you plug in, it checks who you are before letting your traffic on the LAN.

8021q

Adds VLAN tags to Ethernet frames. One cable can carry multiple “virtual” networks that stay separate.

9p

Makes remote resources look like local files. You can mount services/devices and use them with normal file reads/writes.

Appletalk

Apple’s older networking so Macs could find and share stuff on a local network. Mostly legacy now.

Atm

High-speed networking using fixed-size cells. Aimed at steady, predictable traffic on WANs/LANs

ax25

Point-to-point packet radio. Can carry other simple protocols

batman-adv

“Better Approach To Mobile Ad-hoc Networking.” A kernel Layer-2 mesh that forwards across multiple hops, wired or wireless.

bluetooth/bnep

Bnep is used for ethernet emulation as a layer on top of bluetooth. Required for bluetooth PAN.

bluetooth/cmtp

Cmtp is a transport layer used for CAPI messages. Bluetooth common ISDN access profile requires it. 

bluetooth/hidp

HIDP is the transport layer for HID reports. Human interface device points in bluetooth require this. 

bluetooth/rfcomm

RFCOMM is used to make a connection oriented stream transport. Some bluetooth applications that use dialup networking and obex all require this. 

bpf

Tiny programs the kernel can run to filter/observe packets or enforce simple rules. Handy without writing full drivers.

bridge/netfilter

NETFILTER is a configuration that utilizes INET and NETFILTER. This implementation allows the user to classify packets using the NETFILTER infrastructure. NETFILTER keeps track of what packets have moved through a machine. This is primarily used to increase the accuracy of packet filtering. 

caif

CAIF stands for communication CPU to application CPU interface, its a packet based connection oriented mux protocol for use on certain modem platforms.

can

CAN stands for controller area network. Its a networking technology used in automation, embedded devices and automotive fields. 

ceph

Ceph is a scalable file system. Its a cluster that has object block and file interface features.

core

Shared networking plumbing in the kernel: sockets, buffers, and helpers that everything else uses.

dcb

Data Center Bridging. Ethernet tweaks so different traffic types (like storage) get the right treatment and don’t drop.

dccp
DROPPED
devlink

Structured control path for smart NICs/switch chips. Query settings, update firmware, and grab detailed stats.

dns_resolver

This implementation is used to query DNS servers for information. In CIFS, this is used to resolve UNC hostname elements to an IP address. In AFSDB records, this is used to locate a cell’s volume location database servers when performing a DNS query.

dsa

Distributed Switch Architecture. Lets Linux drive embedded switch chips and expose real per-port interfaces.

ethernet

The basic Layer-2 frame/MAC world most networks use. VLANs and lots of other features sit on top of it.

ethtool

Kernel interface for NIC knobs. Check speed/duplex, offloads, queues, pause frames, and driver/firmware info.

handshake

Kernel helper for doing standard crypto/key-exchange handshakes, instead of every driver rolling its own.

hsr
"High-Avalibility Seamless Redundancy" 
Whenever a ethernet data frame is sent out from a hsr enabled device (a ring network of doubly attached nodes) it is duplicated and also sent the oposite direction. This allows for redundancy with no down time if the frame fails. 











ieee802154
A standard for small wireless personal area networks with a maximum data rate of 250 kb/s. 












ife
Adds support for the IFE encaplsulation protocol.
